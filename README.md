I have developed an engaging graphical user interface (GUI) game that features a thrilling 1v1 gameplay experience. The game incorporates the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented programming, resulting in a well-structured and organized codebase. To enhance the visual appeal, I have implemented captivating animations that bring the game characters and objects to life. Additionally, the game boasts realistic physics simulations, ensuring that the in-game body movements accurately reflect the laws of physics. Moreover, I have incorporated the functionality to save the game state using serialization, enabling players to resume their progress at a later time. Overall, this game offers an immersive and enjoyable gaming experience, showcasing a combination of polished visuals, authentic physics, and convenient game-saving features.
